This is Challenge #3 in the bootcamp. 
This time I have created a password generator

First I started and completed 4 different arrays for the generator
Uppercase, lowercase, special characters, and numbers

I included 4 let to ask the questions to generator a password

Then, I did 4 different if statments for the arrays with concat the arrays and then I ended it with a for loop


Included a screenshot:
